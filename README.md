# Windesheim Glade Reader
This repository is made for the Windesheim amazing challenge. It uses image recognition to detect different types of tiles and the number that corresponds to that tile. 

# About this project
A couple of years ago Windesheim decided to move from a table based game board to an image generated on the server. They did this because someone made an exporter for the glade to test it without using any tries.

Ofcourse this didn't stop us from making something that could read the image and transform it to a csv document.

You can use the generated CSV to test your progress with the [Windesheim glade interperter](https://github.com/CalliEve/windesheim_glade)
